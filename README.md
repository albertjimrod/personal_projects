personal and original insights with data

These are some of the personal projects I have been doing:

- `Sonus transcribere`

	This is the first project on this list is , it is a very simple audio transcriber where I use the google API for the first time. While I was studying the Master online I realized that I wasted too much time taking annotations of the videos and that they did not have the possibility to transcribe the text since they were hosted on Vimeo privately. Therefore I had to invent the way to obtain the content of the lessons in a written support and then proceed to the study of the document.

- `FREQUENCY CLASSIFICATION OF SOUND SAMPLES THROUGH THE REDUCTION OF DIMENSIONALITY THROUGH MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING`

	I am not an expert in business analysis and my background is practically based on sound therefore it seemed to me that I should be honest in the realization of the project and apply my experience in the field of sound. I thought it will be appropriate to apply techniques that are used in marketing to group potential customers in the world of sound and thus avoid dependence on data sets, and that's how I carried out this project.



- `Bootstrap Dashboard Interface Design`

	A fairly recurring question that arises was: how could I make a web page that had an integrated machine learning model and that allows the visualization of data?
	
	As the answer did not go through a simple WordPress I start to understand how serious websites were done, and I found Django. 
	
	So I started working on what would be the design of the interface for a page that worked with Django and thus understand the ins and outs of this interesting Framework.
	
	
- `Web_scrapping`
	
	The analysis of data requires the obtaining of data, acquiring that skill I consider necessary within the toolbox of everyone who works with data.
